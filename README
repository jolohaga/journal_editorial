== Journal Editorial Application

The Journal Editorial application is one of two applications intended to
assist managing the editorial process of a peer-reviewed journal.

(The other application, Journal Publication, handles the publication side.)

== Getting Started

This app is written to use PostgreSQL at this time.

To get this application running:

1. Edit the Journal.rb Settings class settings
Give NAMESPACE a capitalized abbreviation based on the journal's name.
Change the following: NAME, CODEN, ISSN, PUBLICATION_SITE, 
EDITORIAL_SITE, OAI_IDENTIFIER, EDITOR_EMAIL, APPLICATION_EMAIL, 
SUPPORT_EMAIL
2. Edit the mail_setup.rb file

3. Edit the database.yml username and password

4. Create the journal_editorial_* databases.  Give them write access by username

5. Run rake journal:initialize

Additionally, you'll want to edit the FormLetters::SIGNATURE in Journal.rb

== Form Letters

The form letters are database stored Erb templates.

The following global variables are available:

NS.editor_email
NS.editorial_site
NS.publication_site
NS.submissions_url
NS.folders_url

Where NS is the journal's capitalized abbreviation set in Settings::NAMESPACE

== State machine

See Submission_state.png for graph of the submission states defined by this application.
